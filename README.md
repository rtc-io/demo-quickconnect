# rtcio-demo-quickconnect

This is a starter project for working with [WebRTC](http://webrtc.org).

## Getting Started

First, clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/rtc-io/rtcio-demo-quickconnect.git
```

Next, install node dependencies:

```
cd rtcio-demo-quickconnect
npm install
```

Once the dependencies have been installed, you should then be able to run
the demonstration server:

```
npm start
```

If everything has worked correctly, you should now be able to open your
browser to the following url:

<http://localhost:3000/>

You can test that you have WebRTC peer connections operating correctly by
opening two browser windows to the same url; or, you can find someone else
that has access to your machine and point them to: <http://your.ip:3000/>.
All being well you should be able to communicate with that person using
WebRTC!
